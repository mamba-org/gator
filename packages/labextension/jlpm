# Fake jlpm that redirects to yarn to avoid workspace conflicts

# This prevents JupyterLab's internal jlpm calls from failing in yarn workspaces.
# When jupyter labextension build runs, it internally calls jlpm which doesn't
# understand yarn workspace configurations and fails during resolution validation.
# 
# This script is placed in PATH during builds to intercept jlpm calls.

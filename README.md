Provides Conda/Mamba environment and package management as a [standalone application](#Navigator) or as extension for [JupyterLab](#JupyterLab).

## Install

_Requirements_

- conda >= 4.5 or mamba >=0.5
- JupyterLab 1.x, 2.x or 3.x (for the JupyterLab extension only)

> Starting from 3.4, this extension will use [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) instead of `conda` if it finds it.

To install in the classical notebook:

```shell
mamba install -c conda-forge mamba_gator
```

To install in the JupyterLab:

```shell
mamba install -c conda-forge jupyterlab mamba_gator
```

If you use JupyterLab 1.x or 2.x, you can install the extension with the following command:

```shell
jupyter labextension install @mamba-org/gator-lab
```

> Optionally, you could install [`jupyterlab-tour`](https://github.com/fcollonval/jupyterlab-tour) to
> add a help tour for the conda packages manager.

## JupyterLab

This extension adds a new entry _Conda Packages Manager_ in the _Settings_ menu.

> The first time, it can take quite some time to build the available packages list. But once it is obtained,
> it will be cached and updated to the background to have a smoother user experience.

## Navigator

This project contains a standalone navigator application sharing much of the code
of the JupyterLab extension.

## Classical Jupyter Notebook

The classical Jupyter Notebook is supported only for version prior to 5. But you can
directly manage the conda environments with the standalone navigator tool. For that
you need to execute the following command in a terminal:

```
gator
```

## Creating New Environments

There are three ways to create an environment:

- Create a new environment
  Use the New Environment button at the top of the page, and select `Python 3`, or `R` to create a
  base environment with the corresponding packages. Note that if you want to run a
  Jupyter python kernel in the new environment, you must also install the `ipykernel`
  package in the environment.

- Clone an existing environment
  Click the clone button next to an environment in the list, and enter the desired name of the
  new environment.

- Import an exported environment from a YAML file

## Development

```shell
mamba create -c conda-forge -y -n gator python jupyterlab=3
mamba install -c conda-forge -y -n gator --file requirements_dev.txt
conda activate gator
pip install -e .
jupyter server extension enable mamba_gator --sys-prefix

yarn install
yarn run build:dev
jupyter labextension link packages/common/ packages/labextension/
```

## Acknowledgements

This work started as a fork by [@fcollonval](https://github.com/fcollonval/) of the Anaconda [nb_conda package](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda). The decision to fork it came due
to apparently dead status of the previous package and a need to integrate it within JupyterLab.

Then with the [mamba initiative](https://medium.com/@QuantStack/open-software-packaging-for-science-61cecee7fc23) pushed by QuantStack it made
sense to move the project in the `mamba-org` organization.

- Switch to newer Python syntax async-await
- To improve UI reactivity in Jupyterlab:

  - Long running task can now be cancelled #32
  - The available packages list is used to find updatable package. conda update --dry-run --all is not used any longer. But it is still used if the user request updating all possible packages.

### 3.1.0

- Request environment list accept now `whitelist`=0 or 1 query arguments. If 1, the environment
  list is filtered to respect `KernelSpecManager.whitelist`. Default is 0, but it could be modified
  in user settings.
- JupyterLab extension
  - `IEnvironmentManager.getPackageManager()` returns always the same `Conda.IPackageManager`
    otherwise signaling package operations would have been meaningless.
  - Add ability to specify kernel companions; i.e. check that if some packages are installed in a
    kernel, they must respect a certain version range. Companions can be specified through user
    settings.
  - Small UI tweaks

### 3.0.0

  - Add signals to handle environnements and packages changes (see `labextension\src\__tests__\services.spec.ts`)
  - Improve the UI reactivity by using `react-virtualized` for the packages list
  - Improve the look and feel
- Available packages truncation has been removed.

### 2.5.1

- Catch SSLError when requesting `channeldata.json` file

### 2.5.0

- Export in YAML format the environment (import in the older format is still supported).
- Improve responsiveness by loading first installed packages. Then request available one.
- BUG error is prompt when an environment is deleted although everything went well
- Cache some API requests (GET environments, GET channels and GET available packages).
- Available packages are now truncated to 100.
  - Use query argument `$skip` to skip N first packages
  - If the list is longer than 100, a entry `$next` in the response is returned. This
    is the request url to use to get the next batch of packages.
- Report full error message in web browser console to ease debugging.

### 2.4.2

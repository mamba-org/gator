# User Guide

This guide covers how to use Gator for managing conda environments and packages.

## JupyterLab Extension

The JupyterLab extension adds a new entry **Conda Packages Manager** in the **Settings** menu.

```{note}
The first time you use it, it can take quite some time to build the available packages list. But once it is obtained, it will be cached and updated in the background to have a smoother user experience.
```

## Standalone Navigator

Gator includes a standalone navigator application that shares much of the code with the JupyterLab extension. You can launch it from the command line:

```bash
gator
```
